								<h3>Team Discussion</h3>
								What is a Secure Programming Language?</br>
								What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</br>
								Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</br>
								Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</br>
								Response:
								How safe a programming language is depending on things like how it handles memory, its rules for using different types of data, and how well its built-in tools work. 
								Python is usually considered safe because it does a good job with memory and has clear rules for data. 
								But no language is completely safe. Python is great for many things, but it’s not the best choice for making operating systems because it’s not fast enough and doesn’t give you as much control over the computer’s hardware. 
								C is better for these things because it’s faster and gives you more control.
								</p>

								<p>
								<h3>Task: Part 1</h3>
								What happens? When 8 characters are Input, the program runs but when more than 8 characters are entered the program displays an error because the buffer is set to 8. If the buffer were to overflow this could impact on the program.
								</br>
								What does the output message mean? The output message means that the program cannot allow more than 8 characters to be inputted. 
								</p>
								<p>
								<h3>Task: Part 2</h3>
								What is the result? Does this tell you how to fix the error above? The pylint highlights the potential errors and tells us as the user how to fix the issue. This would be useful as it would limit the number of bugs in the code as they could be fixed early in the development process.
								</p>
								<p>
								<h3>Summary</h3>
								This week we covered programming languages and their uses. We also looked at compilers and interpreters and their differences. We also looked at the vulnerabilities of programming languages and how these can be helped. We also looked at the key concepts found within python such as pointers and abstraction. We also looked at how the design process of code can be developed to limit the number of bugs and security issues. 
								</br>
								This week I also met with my group for the first time, and we began to plan our project. We started by discussing what the aims of the project were. We also divided up the work into different sections and gave different people different areas to investigate. I was given GDPR and legal requirements. We also all began looking into UML diagrams to prepare for that section of the coursework.
