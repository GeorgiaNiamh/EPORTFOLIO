								The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, should it be? Does it remain relevant today? Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure software? Justify all opinions which support your argument and share your responses with your team.
								</br>
								Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of how complex a piece of code is. Higher complexity means the code is harder to understand and test. While it's a useful tool, it doesn't tell the whole story about code quality.
								</br>
								In modern software development, cyclomatic complexity is still valuable. It can help identify complex parts of code that might be harder to maintain and test. It can also be used to guide code reviews and generate automated tests.
								</br>
								However, cyclomatic complexity has limitations. It doesn't always mean a complex code is bad, and other factors like code style and documentation are also important. Using tools and good practices can help manage complex code, even if it has high cyclomatic complexity.

								<h3>Code task: </h3> 
								I edited some of the features of the code provided. For example, I edited the input range in order to see how the code reacted. I also changed the different equivalence relation. Below are my findings from these experiments.
								</br>
								These experiments confirm that the equivalence partitioning code works correctly and can handle different ranges and relations. It successfully identifies equivalence classes based on the specified criteria. You can further modify the relation to test other conditions, such as divisibility or specific ranges, to see how the code responds.

								<h3>Lecture cast summary: </h3>
								The theme of this week’s lecture was testing. The lecture began by going over some key terms such as testability and validation. These were explained along with black box and white box testing. The lecture also went into detail about when testing should be done during a project. The lecture also gave tips on developing a test plan. 
								</br>
								The lecture also covered different ways that projects can be penetrated such as with poison packages and typo-squatting. This was then added to with discussion of the OWASP principles of testing. This then went into how we can prevent these issues such as with the use of linters and different testing approaches.

								<h3>Group task:</h3>
								This week we met again and discussed the paragraphs we had each written and went over the key sections and again gave out sections of writing to each member. One member was given the UML diagrams at this stage and we discussed what should be included in them. We agreed to meet again the following week and show our next paragraphs. Also in the session we created a shared document that we could paste our work to so it could be reviewed throughout the week.
