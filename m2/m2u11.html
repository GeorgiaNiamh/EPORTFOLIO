								<h3>Forum task:</h3>
								I disagree with the claim that "Torvalds has been proven wrong and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices and microkernels are the future." While microkernels and microservices have gained popularity due to their modularity and fault isolation, saying they are the future for all cases ignores the practicality and advantages of monolithic designs in many areas.
								</br>In the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate, Linus Torvalds argued for the simplicity and performance of monolithic kernels, and the success of Linux—a monolithic kernel—proves this point. Linux powers millions of servers, desktops, and mobile devices (like Android) because of its high performance and reliability. This continued dominance shows that monolithic designs still have a strong place in software architecture (DiBona & Ockman, 1999).
								</br>While microservices are scalable and flexible, they aren't always the best choice. Refactoring monolithic systems into microservices can introduce complexity and overhead. According to Fritzsch et al. (2019), issues like finding the right service granularity and managing dependencies make these transitions costly and difficult. Bass et al. (2015) also note that microservices are not a universal solution, as breaking down an application into small services can increase complexity and latency.
								</br>In conclusion, microservices and microkernels have their place, especially in cloud-based environments, but they aren't universally better. Torvalds’ views on monolithic kernels are still valid, as seen in the widespread use of Linux and the challenges with adopting microservices at scale.

								<h3>Project update:</h3> 
								I found this week quite stressful in terms of getting my project submitted. I worked hard to try and fix all the bugs before submission by doing final tests with Pytest and using Pylint. Overall, I feel the project I have produced and submitted is adequate, but I don’t necessarily feel like it was my best work. I think I did all I could with my time, but I still think that it was a difficult task to complete in the time given. I am just happy it is now completed. I feel I did my best with my skills to deliver the project although I am slightly unsure if it fits the brief.
