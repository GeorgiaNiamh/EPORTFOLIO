								<h3>Tower of Hanoi task:</h3>
								What is the (theoretical) maximum number of disks that your program can move without generating an error?
								</br>
								What limits the number of iterations? What is the implication for application and system security?
								</br>
								Python has a limit on how many times a function can call itself. For the Towers of Hanoi, the number of recursive steps grows rapidly as the number of disks increases. By default, Python allows around 1000 recursive calls before it raises an error. This limits the number of disks to about 30â€“40 before the program crashes.
								</br>
								Each recursive call uses memory. If you try to solve the puzzle with too many disks, the program will eventually use up all available memory and crash.
								</p>

								<h3>UK Postcode task:</h3> 
								How do you ensure your solution is not subject to an evil regex attack?
								</br>
								Avoid overly complex or nested regex patterns. Our postcode regex is simple and doesn't contain catastrophic backtracking, which is often the cause of ReDoS attacks.
								</br>
								If your system allows it, set a maximum execution time for regex evaluations. This prevents the program from getting stuck processing malicious input.
								</br>
								Restrict the length of the user input before applying the regex. For postcodes, you can limit the input to something reasonable (e.g., 8-10 characters) since postcodes are short strings.
								</br>
								Before applying regex, do a basic check on input length or structure to filter out obviously invalid data, which avoids unnecessary regex checks.
								</p>

								<h3>Seminar summary:</h3>
								In this seminar we added to the knowledge from the lecture cast of last week around the theme of programming language concepts. We also discussed the different types of programming such as functional programming and event driven programming. We also looked more in-depth at key terminology such as abstraction and encapsulation. This seminar was very interesting as it allowed me to look at programming from different perspectives. 
								</p>
								<p>
								<h3>Group task:</h3>
								We met as a group again this week and discussed our research with each other. This helped us to plan exactly what was necessary for our project. We then decided to each take a section and begin to draft a paragraph or section each. I decided to start with the GDPR paragraph. Overall, I am happy with the progress of the group task so far. I am slightly anxious as I am the least experienced member of the team so sometimes find it difficult to follow the discussions, but I make sure to ask questions when I need to.
