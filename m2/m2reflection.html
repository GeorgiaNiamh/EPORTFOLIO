								<h3>Reflecting on Secure Software Development Computer Science</h3>
                                I have found that secure software development module has been a very quick and steep learning curve for me. In this reflection I will reflect on the process and comment on what I think went well and what could have been improved on my part. 
                                </br>Firstly, I am going to discuss the group task. I found the group task both enjoyable and difficult in equal measures. I enjoyed being able to collaborate with other students and get to know them. This was very useful as it helped me to see the project we worked on from many different perspectives. With this being said, there were some challenges with the group process. The first was meeting with the team. This was made difficult because of how widespread across the globe we were. This was made more difficult due to me having to travel to Seoul during the project for personal reasons. With this being said I think that we made it work even if the timing of the meetings was difficult at times. I found working within the group very rewarding as it was a taste of an authentic development process. I found the international element, though challenging at times, a good reflection of modern software engineering, that often involves international teams working as one.
                                </br>Also, within the group tasks there were a couple of things I would have changed with our approach to the project. I felt at times that we did not have a coherent plan with what exactly we were intending to create. This was in part because we did not discuss what features we would want as a team before dividing up the work. This did cause me some problems in the development process as some of the features I found difficult to implement or I decided to change to ensure I created a project that functioned. If I were to approach this again, I would suggest a clear plan being written up, before the work was divided, to reduce disagreements later on.
                                </br>Secondly, I will discuss the reading, lectures and seminars for the module. I found the reading for the module to be very varied. Some of the articles I found very accessible and interesting to read while others I found confusing, and it took me a while to fully grasp what the key information was. The lecture casts again were very informative although at some points I felt that the lecture casts tried to cover too much information making them feel disjointed in the information they were delivering. Finally, the seminars I found very enjoyable when I attended them. I found the informative and generally a good place to gain further understanding of topics being taught. Sadly, though, due to work commitments I was not always able to attend the seminars which I think limited their usefulness even if I watched the recording as I was not able to take part in the discussion aspect. In order to get the most out of the materials, in future I plan to divide the lecture casts up to allow me to fully absorb the information. I also plan on reading around more if I find something difficult to grasp. With the seminars I think I need to make better use of the tutor in order to ask questions.
                                </br>Thirdly, I will discuss the work for the discussion forums. I found these tasks interesting to complete although I did often write my ideas and forget to submit them to the forum. I also found it was a good way to interact with my peers by seeing what ideas they had about articles and technologies. I wish that these discussions could have been slightly more regular to assist in this peer-to-peer discourse. In future I might take it upon myself to interact more with my peers outside of designated tasks, I also plan to make sure things are not only written, but also submitted.
                                </br>Finally I shall reflect on the individual project that I created. I found this project very challenging as it really tested my python skill set. I also found that the design document we had created included features that were not feasible within the timeframe. This led to me having to make changes from the original document. I also found the guidance around the final project was difficult to follow and that I was unsure of what exactly was expected. Within my project I decided to make changes to the original design in several ways. One of these changes was using a server-client setup instead of using redis as specified in the document. This was because I was unfamiliar with redis and could not find a way to implement it without having to share my account details. Perhaps with more time I may have worked out a way to use redis but I felt with the time constraints that I could not adequately learn this and deliver the product in time.
                                </br>I found that the idea of hacking the project unusual, as I found the idea of leaving a vulnerability within the code for me to then exploit as the hacker confusing, as my instinct would be to immediately fix a know vulnerability. I found the guidance for what to include and how things should be implemented were delivered too late for me to implement them without having to make changes to my script.
                                </br>In conclusion there are several ways I hope to improve my software development in the future. Firstly I plan to create clear design documents that outline all features in a way that is easy to follow. I also plan on improving my python skills, to make these projects easier and less time consuming to allow me to properly test them.
