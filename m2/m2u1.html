								<h3>Seminar 1 prep:</h3>
								To prepare for this seminar I looked through the teamwork documents such as the teamwork contract and the teamwork guidance. I found this useful as it helped me to understand how the university handles group tasks. I am looking forward to beginning the group task. I also reviewed the submission summaries to see what the coursework tasks for the module will be.  
								I also worked my way through the first lecture cast in preparation for the seminar. I found the theme of cybercrime very interesting especially looking at how it can be prevented. I also found looking into how software can be created to maintain security very interesting especially looking at agile and waterfall approaches to development. 
								The lecture also introduces the idea of UML diagrams and how they can be used to model programs before they are created. I had a look at some UML examples by watching some videos online.

								<h3>Seminar summary:</h3> 
								In this seminar it introduced the module with an introduction from the lecturer and other students. We also were told and overview for the structure of the module as well as recommended readings for the module. 
								The seminar then went on to look at the what software development was and the components of software development. This was useful as it assisted in understanding the role of software development in more depth and helped me to see the whole process. 
								The seminar then looked at what secure software development was and how it could be used as well as the key features. The seminar recovered some areas from the lecture cast such as waterfall and agile models as well as UML diagrams. 
								We were then given the task to create a UML diagram and create a diagram to represent one of the OWASP coding weaknesses.

								<h3>Unit 1 task:</h3>
								Injection poses a risk to computer security as outlined by OWASP who ranked injection as the 3rd most important risk to web applications. (OWASP, 2021).
								Injection attacks can lead to the theft of many assets from an association such as sensitive data. (UC Berkley, 2024). Injection attacks pose a particular threat when using shared networks as injections can be used to not only steal information but also to install malicious software. (GuardRails, 2023).
								To help in the prevention of injection attacks networks and data must be secured. As outlined by Kime (2023) there are 5 keyways to help prevent injection attacks. These are: filter database inputs, restrict database code, restrict database access, maintain applications and databases, monitor application and database inputs and communications. (Kime, 2023). Each of these approaches outlined by Kime assist in reduction the chance of an injection attack by limiting the inputs that can be made by a user and ensuring that technology is maintained to prevent vulnerabilities.
								Below is a UML diagram showing how a potential injection attack may occur. The use of injection attacks has become 5 times more common than presentation attacks due to the use of AI and deepfakes (Painter, 2024). This shows the relevance of injection attacks as a threat to modern cyber security.
